Exercise 2.1

1. To compute  2**(521 - 1) * (2**521 - 1): (* (expt 2 520) (- (expt 2 521) 1)) -->

   To compute 7^(5^4): (expt 7 (expt 5 4)) --> 2135150283747857799
2. Compute how many bits are needed to store number: 
   For 2**(521 - 1) * (2**521 - 1) use (+ 521 (log (- (expt 2 521) 1) 2)) --> 1042 ln(-1042 expt) 
	calculate above with C-u C-x * e
   For 7^(5^4) use (+ (log (expt 7 (expt 5 4)) 2) 1) --> 61
3. 
C-h k C-h k would pop up a description of "C-h k runs the command describe-key", due to C-h k being
bind to describe-key, and pressing it twice would be looking up the function of C-h k.

C-h k M-SPC would show the function of M-SPC, or just-one-space, as "Delete all spaces and tabs around point, 
leaving one space (or N spaces). If N is negative, delete newlines as well, leaving -N spaces.", because C-h k helps describe-key.

Source code of M-SPC is:

(defun just-one-space (&optional n)                                                                      |
  "Delete all spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space (or N spaces).                             |
If N is negative, delete newlines as well, leaving -N spaces.                                            |
See also `cycle-spacing'."                                                                               |
  (interactive "*p")                                                                                     |
  (cycle-spacing n nil 'single-shot))

Exercise 2.3
1. The file /dev/null is an empty file, meaning when randline.py tries to read from the file
and index the elements in the file, it assumes the file has something in it.
When run the command $python2 randline.py /dev/null I get:
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 277, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range
As the seq is empty we get the index error.

2. I would get this error if I run it in python3:
File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
This is due to exceptions in python2 being iterable, and you can iterate over the parameters 
given to the exception by iterating over the exception itself.
As automatic tuple unpacking has been removed in Python3, (errno, strerror) passed in an exception
gives an error as this is a tuple.

A fix would be to pass a single parameter in:
	except IOError as err:

3. If I run this python2 I get this error:
match ir_str.split("-"):
               ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Due to this not being a feature in python2
