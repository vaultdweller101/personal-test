Changes compared to tic-tac-toe
###############################

Additional rules are implemented in handleClick.
A few things are different in handleClick:

- After both sides placed their 3rd piece, a notification would 
pop up saying that players can only move existing pieces 
from then onwards.
- This would be done by player picking one of the pieceand then 
move it
- There would be a check for adjacency 
- If piece in center exists, force the player to move that one,
or win in the next move.

Checks for when it's time to move pieces if the move steps > 5 
and no winner is detected then.

Implementation for moving the piece:
- Select a piece and turn it to blank
- Next move, select a blank square adjacent to original i 
while storing the previous i.
- If the same square is picked, then nothing changes, and then 
have it still be X's turn.
Otherwise change turns again
- If one of your piece is in the center, force movement of that 
piece to an empty one unless there is a winning move. Do this 
by reject moves until the player undo

How to play from turn 3 onwards
################################


Once the notification "Cannot add more. Must move existing 
pieces." popped up, the player must select one of their 
piece by click on the piece on the board. Once clicked,
the piece would dissapear. Then, if a player choose an 
invalid move, nothing happened and the piece remain dissapear.
Only when you choose the adjacent blank square would 
the game allow you to place your piece
and move forward to the next player.
Undoing turn is recorded in the history section for 
easy access.
