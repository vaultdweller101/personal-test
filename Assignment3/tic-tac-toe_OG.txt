Created git commit.

Success! Created my-app at C:\Users\Mr Dung\my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, 
configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, 
you cannot go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!

Code that I type in and experiment with in tic-tac-toe
#######################################################
After adding {this.props.value} the square now shows the square value

Change <button className="square">{...}</button> to 
<button className="square" onClick={() => console.log('click') }>{...}</button>
to start showing clicks in Edge's console section (which should be similar to Chrome)

Adding constructor to props to initialize state as null

Replace this.props.value with this.state.value 
and onClick={...} with onClick={() => this.setState({value: 'X'}) }
to start showing X wherever you click

Add in constructor for Board and initialize as follow: 
squares: Array(9).fill(null) 
to set the Boardâ€™s initial state to contain an array of 9 nulls 
corresponding to the 9 square.

Transform code so that Square is now controlled by Board

With slice(), create a copy of the array instead of modifying existing array
for the ability of undoing and detecting change

Change square from class that extends React.component to function.

Adding ability to take turns in tic-tac-toe with:

class Board extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      squares: Array(9).fill(null),
      xIsNext: true,
    };
  }

class Board extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {...}
  
  handleClick(i) {
    const squares = this.state.squares.slice();
    squares[i] = this.state.xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O';
    this.setState({
      squares: squares,
      xIsNext: !this.state.xIsNext,
    });
  }

Adding ability to calculate who won. Ignore clicks once someone won

Adding undoing ability
